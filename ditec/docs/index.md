# Tut for writer

This is the default view and should not be overriden.

To create a wiki for your project so-called `Project A`, please do the following steps:

1. Clone the project at [here](https://github.com/DiTEC-project/DiTEC-project.github.io).

2. Run command `pip install mkdocs` to start working on wiki with MKDOCS.

3. Create a new directory whose name is matched your project name.

4. Add markdown files into the directory. Note that each markdown represents a page of the wiki.

5. Check `mkdocs.yml` and layout your wiki structure.

6. For development, run `mkdocs serve` to show the view on localhost.

7. For deployment to the Github Page, follow (this tutorial)[https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/]
