# GiDA - The Gigantic Dataset

This work includes a collection of synthetic scenarios devised from 36 **Water Distribution Networks (WDNs)**. 

For the sake of clarity, it would be better to get into familiarized concepts:

* **Scenario** denotes as a sequence of snapshots.

* **Snapshot** represents a measured steady-state of a particular WDN and is often modelled as an undirect graph.

* **Input parameters** includes simulation inputs, such as demands, pipe diameter, and so on.

* **Output parameters** includes simulation outcomes which researchers are interested in (e.g., pressure, flow rate, head, ...)

Both parameters are described as nodal/edge features in the snapshot graph. Their values are diverse but temporal correlated with those of other snapshots in the **same** scenario. 
However, in GiDA, two scenarios are considered completely different WDNs despite their origin being the same network.
